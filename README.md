## üéì About the SIGCSE 2025 Tutorial

This tutorial is designed for **SIGCSE 2025 attendees** interested in enhancing programming education using interactive, IDE-integrated courses. By the end of this tutorial, you‚Äôll be able to:

- Create in-IDE programming courses in Kotlin, Java, or Python with the [**JetBrains Academy Plugin**](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10081-jetbrains-academy).
- Seamlessly track and analyze student problem-solving behavior with the [**KOALA**](https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/tasktracker-3) tool.
- Gain actionable insights from the collected data.

## Tutorial Overview

This tutorial is split into three parts, designed to guide participants through all aspects of creating, tracking, and analyzing in-IDE programming courses:


1Ô∏è‚É£ **Creating In-IDE Courses**
- Learn how to create in-IDE courses using Kotlin, Java, or Python.
- Use the [**JetBrains Academy Plugin**](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10081-jetbrains-academy) to create interactive learning experiences directly in the IDE.
- Let your students engage with well-structured tasks in a hands-on coding environment.


2Ô∏è‚É£ **Setting Up the KOALA Tool**
- Introduce the power of [**KOALA**](https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/tasktracker-3) (a tool for tracking problem-solving processes).
- Understand how to integrate [**KOALA**](https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/tasktracker-3) into your in-IDE course.
- Configure [**KOALA**](https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/tasktracker-3) seamlessly in your IDE for data collection.


3Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Collection & Analysis**
- Learn how to collect tracking data using [**KOALA**](https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/tasktracker-3) while students solve tasks in _student mode_ of the course.
- Convert the collected data into a well-known [**ProgSnap2**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3341525.3387373) format.
- Analyze the data, calculate basic statistical measures, and draw meaningful insights.
