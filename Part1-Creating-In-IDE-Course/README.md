# Part 1. Creating In-IDE Courses

Welcome to **Part 1** of the **Creating In-IDE Programming Courses Tutorial**! 
In this section, we focus on building interactive programming courses directly within an IDE using **Kotlin**, **Java**, or **Python**. 
After completing this part, you'll have a simple in-IDE course that can be used for teaching in a classroom or shared with students.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal of This Part

The goal of this part is to create an in-IDE course using Kotlin, Java, or Python. Youâ€™ll learn how to create 
programming lessons that include **theory**, **quizzes**, and **coding tasks**.

---

## ðŸ—’ Overview of Steps

This part is broken down into the following tasks:

1. **Creating a Course from a Template**: Start with a basic structure for your course.
2. **Adding a Theory Task**: Add a theory part to help learners to study the programming concepts.
3. **Adding a Quiz**: Create single or multiple-choice questions.
4. **Adding a Coding Task**: Introduce coding challenges and hands-on programming practice.
5. **Adding a Guided Project**: Combine several coding tasks into a larger, connected project to teach students how to solve complex problems step by step.
6. **Configuring Code Quality Inspections**: Set up automated code inspections to ensure solutions meet your course's standards.

All tasks in this part are provided for **Kotlin**, **Java**, and **Python**, with language-specific implementation details.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

This repository is organized to make it easy for you to navigate through the steps of creating your in-IDE course.


```
Part1-Creating-In-IDE-Courses/
â”œâ”€â”€ Kotlin/                  # Materials for Kotlin-specific courses
â”œâ”€â”€ Java/                    # Materials for Java-specific courses
â”œâ”€â”€ Python/                  # Materials for Python-specific courses
â”œâ”€â”€ Ready-Courses/           # Fully built sample courses for all three languages
â””â”€â”€ README.md                # This documentation file
```

- Each language folder (`Kotlin/`, `Java/`, and `Python/`) contains the same set of tasks, but with **different implementations depending on the targeted language**.
- If you'd like to skip the tutorial steps and go straight to the finished course, you can find pre-made materials in the **`Ready-Courses/`** folder.

---

Before you begin, ensure you have the template repository for 
the targeted language for your course which is opened in IntelliJ IDEA or PyCharm IDE:

- [Kotlin course template](https://github.com/jetbrains-academy/kotlin-course-template)
- [Java course template](https://github.com/jetbrains-academy/java-course-template)
- [Python course template](https://github.com/jetbrains-academy/python-course-template)
