You're planning your outfit for the 
day based on the weather! Write a Kotlin program 
that uses the **conditional operator** (`if` expression) 
to decide what to wear:

- If the temperature is **above 25**, return: `"It's hot! Wear shorts and a t-shirt."`
- If the temperature is **between 15 and 25 (inclusive)**, return: `"It's mild! Wear jeans and a light sweater."`
- If the temperature is **below 15**, return: `"It's cold! Wear a jacket and long pants."`
