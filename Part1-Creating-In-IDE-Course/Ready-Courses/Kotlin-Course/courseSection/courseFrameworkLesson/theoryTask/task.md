Imagine you're creating a system for a library to help readers quickly locate books. 
Each book is assigned a unique **ID** number thatâ€™s stored in a list. 
The list of book IDs is **sorted in ascending order**.

Your task is to implement a function that performs 
a **binary search** to determine if a specific book ID exists in the library's collection.
