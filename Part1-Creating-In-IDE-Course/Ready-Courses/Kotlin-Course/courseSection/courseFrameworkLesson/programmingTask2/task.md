The library is a bit chaotic today—one of the books has gone **missing**, 
and it's your job to find it! Fortunately, the librarian gave you a **sorted list of book IDs**, 
but it’s **huge,** and manually checking each one would take forever. 
To save the day (and some precious time), you’ll need to use the **binary search algorithm**.

**What You Need to Do:**
You need to implement the function **`binarySearchBook`**, which will searchi for a book in our library:
This function will:
1. Search for the **target book ID** (`targetId`) in the sorted list of book IDs (`bookIds`).
2. If the target ID exists in the list, return the **index** of the book.
3. If the target ID doesn’t exist, return **-1**
