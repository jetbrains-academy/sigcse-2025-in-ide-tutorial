The library is expanding, and new books keep arriving every day!
But thereâ€™s one problem... the librarian accidentally lost *all* the book ID records! ðŸ˜±ðŸ“‰

Your task is to help the library restore order by writing a function that generates a list of random book IDs.


**What You Need to Do:**
You need to implement the function **`generateBookIds`**, which will create a list of **random book IDs** for our library. Each book ID should:
1. Be an integer number between **0 and 500** (inclusive).
2. Be **unique** (no two books should have the same ID).
3. The number of book IDs generated can **vary (e.g., between 5 to 20 books)** each time the function is run. The library has unpredictable needs!
