You're planning your outfit for the
day based on the weather! Write a Java program
that uses the **conditional operator** (`if` expression)
to decide what to wear:

- If the temperature is **above 25**, print: `"It's hot! Wear shorts and a t-shirt."`
- If the temperature is **between 15 and 25 (inclusive)**, print: `"It's mild! Wear jeans and a light sweater."`
- If the temperature is **below 15**, print: `"It's cold! Wear a jacket and long pants."`
