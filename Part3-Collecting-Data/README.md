# Part 3. Data Collection & Analysis

In this part, you will learn the practical steps involved in:

1. **Data Collection**:
    - Using the [**TaskTracker**](https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/tasktracker-3) to collect data during the task-solving process.
    - Viewing the solving process from the student's perspective.

2. **Data Analysis**:
    - Downloading the collected data from a remote server.
    - Converting the data into the [ProgSnap2](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3341525.3387373) format for standardization.
    - Performing a basic analysis of the converted data.

## ðŸ“Š Data Analysis

Follow these steps for analyzing the collected data:

1. **Download the Gathered Data**:
    - TODO: Add details for this step later.

2. **Convert Data to [ProgSnap2](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3341525.3387373) Format**:
    - ProgSnap2 is a widely used format for storing and analyzing education-related programming data.
    - Weâ€™ve developed a converter to help automate this conversion.
    - To initiate the data conversion process:
        - TODO: Add details for this step later.

3. **Perform a Basic Analysis**:
    - After converting the data to ProgSnap2 format, weâ€™ll conduct a simple analysis of the collected information.
    - TODO: Add details for this step later.

More details will be provided and demonstrated during the live session.
